<h2>Visualization</h2>
<p>Promoting gender equality in the polotical system and agreement will create better connections and bridge the gender gaps,where by straining the other gender which is the female with some minimal activities that is not productive in their lives.Women can also take part in the political sytem and lead just like the males do. </p>
<h3>The young generation</h3>
<p>Many young people are home during this time. How might they navigate this time and what can they engage themselves in.
These are the times when the young people can come up with youth groups that volunteers to support the vulnerable like the aged who might not be able to help themselve.since  corona is here with us and the government is still thinking of ways to manage it,here is time and best opportunity for   young people to come up with ideas that can help in managing this virus in Kenya.Also they can use their creative skills  or talents that is outside book work to keep themselves busy and not get their brains corrupt with unnecessary activities like smoking,early relationships that can lead to unwanted early pregnancies,watching ponographic movies that can create an ‘urge of experimenting’ since we are in the era of great exposure to  the new technology that is growing really first annually.
Keeping them busy also by opening free forums that allows play a role in their communities, like tree planting sessions,creating awareness about the deadly virus and instilling positive mindset amongst themselves.Also there are those young people coming from remote areas who might not be that exposed to some life skills education,this could be an opportunity to invite the other youths to  promite awareness to these other youths in the remote areas.</p>
